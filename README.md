# Machine-Learning-Project-
Hey thre this is my machine Learning Repository and here I have implemented ML (machine learning) using python programming language and various libraries such as sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, etc. 

- [Libraries Used](#libraries-used)
- [Project 1](#project-1)

## Libraries Used
[Pandas Website](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[NumPy Website](https://numpy.org/)

[TensorFlow Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[scikit-learn Website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project 1
In this first project I have done Data Preprocessing, Spltting the data into Train Test Split, Feature Scaling using Standard Scaler, Getting the Mean Squared Error usign Linear regression and finally plotting the accuracy precision and Recall
