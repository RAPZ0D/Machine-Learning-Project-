# Machine-Learning-Project-
Hey thre this is my machine Learning Repository and here I have implemented ML (machine learning) using python programming language and various libraries such as sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, etc. 

- [Libraries Used](#libraries-used)
- [Project 1](#project-1)
- [Project 2](#project-2)
- [Project 3](#project-3)
- [Project 4](#project-4)

## Libraries Used
[Pandas Website](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[NumPy Website](https://numpy.org/)

[TensorFlow Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[scikit-learn Website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project 1
In this first project I have done Data Preprocessing, Spltting the data into Train Test Split, Feature Scaling using Standard Scaler, Getting the Mean Squared Error usign Linear regression and finally plotting the accuracy precision and Recall

## Project 2 
In my project 2 I have used some ML library called Sklearn, In the code I have performed some functions using:
1. K Nearest Neighbours
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Naive Bayes
4. Decision Tree Classifier
5. Random Forest Classifier
 
All the code including its visualiation have been performed in this Project

## Project 3
In this project I have mainly focused on Visualizations, I have used Sklearn Library, In this lab I have made the use of: 
1. K means Clustering Visualization
2. Hierarchical Clustering Visualization

## Project 4 
This Project Focuses on NLP (Natural Language Processing), I have used the NLTK library and performed some functions: 
1. Text Tokenization
2. Stopword Removal
3. Stemming
4. Lemmatization
5. Sentiment Analysis
