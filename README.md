# Machine-Learning-Project-
Hey thre this is my machine Learning Repository and here I have implemented ML (machine learning) using python programming language and various libraries such as sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, etc.

## Libraries Used
[Pandas Website](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[NumPy Website](https://numpy.org/)

[TensorFlow Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[scikit-learn Website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project 1
In this first project I have done Data Preprocessing, Spltting the data into Train Test Split, Feature Scaling using Standard Scaler, Getting the Mean Squared Error usign Linear regression and finally plotting the accuracy precision and Recall

## Project 2 
In my project 2 I have used some ML library called Sklearn, In the code I have performed some functions using:
1. K Nearest Neighbours
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Naive Bayes
4. Decision Tree Classifier
5. Random Forest Classifier
 
All the code including its visualiation have been performed in this Project

## Project 3
In this project I have mainly focused on Visualizations, I have used Sklearn Library, In this lab I have made the use of: 
1. K means Clustering Visualization
2. Hierarchical Clustering Visualization

## Project 4 
This Project Focuses on NLP (Natural Language Processing), I have used the NLTK library and performed some functions: 
1. Text Tokenization
2. Stopword Removal
3. Stemming
4. Lemmatization
5. Sentiment Analysis

## Project 5
Project 5 focuses on Neural Network, Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another. 
I have used Tensorflow Library and the csv dataset wihich I have included in the folder, to create a simple ANN.

## Project 6
My 6th Project folder includes 
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. Kernel PCA 

## Project 7
Project 7 consists of model boosting libraries used from sklearn, In this Project I have used the following:
